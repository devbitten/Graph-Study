Implement Breadth First search and Depth First Search for a graph. 
Your program should output at every step, nodes in the fringe, and 
the current node traversed. Show the output on the graph in the 
attached file. Finally, the program must output the complete sequence 
of nodes traversed. Note that the sequence depends on the  whether 
you follow DFS or BFS. Node 0 is the start node. You should submit 
code and the screenshot of output in a single word file.

Note: To show the queue content, you can use two queues for that 
purpose, when you dequeue an element, display it, and finally enqueue 
the element in the other queue. And then in the end, all the elements 
goes back to the original queue. Same with the stack.

Your program should accept following file as an input. You have to 
write code to process this input. You should define and use adjacency 
list representation of graph.

The input in the file is in this format:

First line is number of nodes.

Rest of lines are in this format: node number (node degree) : adjacency list
